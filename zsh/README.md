## What is ZSH?
- **ZSH**, also called the **Z shell**, is an extended version of the Bourne Shell (**sh**), with plenty of new features, and support for plugins and themes.
-  Since it’s based on the same shell as Bash, ZSH has many of the same features, and switching over is a breeze.

## Why Use ZSH?
- ZSH has too many features to list here, some just minor improvements to Bash, but here are some of the major ones:
  - **Automatic cd**: Just type the name of the directory
  - **Recursive path expansion**: For example “/u/lo/b” expands to “/usr/local/bin”
  - **Spelling correction and approximate completion**: If you make a minor mistake typing a directory name, ZSH will fix it for you
  - **Plugin and theme suppor**t: ZSH includes many different plugin frameworks


## Oh My ZSH
- **Oh My Zsh** is an open source, community-driven framework for managing your Zsh configuration.
- It is the most popular plugin framework for ZSH, and it comes with many built-in plugins and themes as well.
