## What is version control?
- **Version control**, also known as **source control**, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.
- **Version control systems** (VCSs) are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time

## Why version control is useful?
- Even when you’re working by yourself, it can let you look at old snapshots of a project, keep a log of why certain changes were made, work on parallel branches of development, and much more.
- When working with others, it’s an invaluable tool for seeing what other people have changed, as well as resolving conflicts in concurrent development.
- Modern VCSs also let you easily (and often automatically) answer questions like:
  - Who wrote this module?
  - When was this particular line of this particular file edited? By whom? Why was it edited?
  - Over the last 1000 revisions, when/why did a particular unit test stop working?

## What is Git?
- Originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, **Git** is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
- While other VCSs exist, Git is the de facto standard for version control.

## Getting Started
- The version control (git) course from [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/)  (a class from **MIT**) provides good explanations about the usage of git and some exercises for it.
- This [git guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) by Roger Dudler also provides a simple guide for getting started with git.
