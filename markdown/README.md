## What is a Markup Language?
- A **markup language** is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. It is human-readable, meaning markup files contain standard words, rather than typical programming syntax. While several markup languages exist, the two most popular are **HTML** and **XML**.

## What is Markdown?
- **Markdown** is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.

## Why Use Markdown?
- It can be used for everything
  - Websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.
- Portable
  - Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application.
  - That’s in stark contrast to word processing applications like Microsoft Word that lock your content into a proprietary file format.
- Platform independent
  - You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.
- Future proof
  - If the application you’re using stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application.
  - This is an important consideration when it comes to books, university theses, and other milestone documents that need to be preserved indefinitely.
- It is everywhere
  - Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown.

## Getting Started
- The best way to get started with Markdown is to use it. Many text editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) support [markdown preview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown) so you can see the rendered document while editing it.
- Many websites provide [basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and [extended syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/) documentation (even some provide the [cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)!) that can be used as your references to write a markdown document.
